%description
LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix. It is designed to
avoid redundant copying and storing of data that other clients and libraries
suffer from. Licensed under the GPL.

Basic features have been implemented and a ncurses client is included. Sloppy
and biased test runs have shown that transferring a 200 MB file with libTorrent
uses 1/4 of the CPU time that the official BitTorrent client requires.

The library and client are under heavy development. They are stable enough to
handle any torrents I throw at them these days.
